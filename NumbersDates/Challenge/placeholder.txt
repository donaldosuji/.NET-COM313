Assignment: Building a "How Many Days?" Console Application in C#

Objective:

Create a console application that asks the user to enter a date and then tells them how many days 
have passed since that date or how many days remain until that date. The program should run 
continuously until the user enters "exit".

Requirements:

1. Prompt the user to enter a date or type "exit" to quit the program.
2. Parse the entered date and check if it is valid.
3. Compare the entered date with the current date to determine if it is in the past, present, 
or future.
4. Display the appropriate message based on the comparison.
5. Handle invalid date inputs gracefully by showing an error message.
6. The program should loop until the user decides to exit.

Flexibility:

You can solve this problem using different looping constructs (like while, do-while, for, etc.), or 
you can use recursion if you prefer. You can also handle user input and date parsing in various 
ways. Below are examples of different methods to solve the assignment
